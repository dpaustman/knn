Version 1.0:

This project focuses on creating a MapReduce program for Hadoop so that it can be run for the dataset (which can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Poker+Hand )

This program will then be used to test and compare the performance of the Hadoop Framework for different physical variables as well as it's accuracy.


Version 2.0:

Added Scala code so as to process the same data on Spark with YARN whilst varying similar parameters.
(Code not optimised yet and only works on standalone Spark Installations.)
